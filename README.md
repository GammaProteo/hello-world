# hello-world
Just a short introduction as my first action during the introduction to GIT

My name is Martin,

I am a PhD student at CEITEC MU, studying structural biology programme, with focus on prokaryotic RNAP complexes. I try to do so, by using NMR spectroscopy and CRYO electron microscopy.
Formerly, I am an ex-microbiologist, delving into the research of natural microbiomes.


For these reasons, I have to learn several languages, like bash, awk, perl and python. For this and other reasons, I started a GitHub to have better track of my progress.
